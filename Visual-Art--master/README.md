the fun of colouring!
Team name: 20,000 leagues under the sea

Project name: Virtual Art

Student 1 name: Wu XiaoXiao

Student 2 name: Nguyen Hong Van

Project scope: Android application

Aimed level of achievement: Project Gemini

Motivation: We want to create an art & craft app for toddlers and pre-schoolers that is easy to use, and still allows them to create artworks from their imagination.

Planned Features:

We plan to have 3 main features: Drawing, Colouring and Textures. Our app will also allow users to post and share their virtual artworks on Facebook.

Actual Features:

We reduced the features to Drawing and Colouring, and have successfully implemented the sharing function for Facebook.

 

Original user stories:

1. May (5 years old) likes to play with artworks but is unsatisfied with her own drawings. Using our colouring features, she will be able to create her own artworks (that she will be happy with) without struggling with drawing something from scratch.

=> We have been able to add attractive pictures to be used as templates for drawing and coloring, so users like May will definitely be satisfied with the final results. Our drawing and colouring function with a wide variety of colours to choose from will keep her from getting bored and discouraged with her drawing progress.

2. Jon (pre-schooler) likes to do art and craft, especially making artworks with glitter and glue, but neither his parents nor him likes to clean up after Jon had done his artwork. The glitter was especially annoying as it would go all over the place and stick to Jonâ€™s hands and arms, and the glue was sticky with allowed dirt to stick to Jon when he accidentally spilled it over himself.

=> With the Virtual Art app, the process of cleaning up after playing with glitter and glue was eliminated since the materials are trapped inside the screen of the device. We also included a wide range of drawings to choose from and Jon will be able to switch the colour of the materials with a spectrum, making the process more enjoyable.

List of finalized features:

1. Drawing: users can choose from 3 brush sizes.

2. Colouring: users get to choose from a wide variety of beautiful colours.

3. Saving: allows users to save their drawings to their devices.

4. New: allows users to create new drawings.

5. Erase: users choose from 3 eraser sizes.

6. Share: users can share their drawings on Facebook. The app will ask the user to save the drawing first before sharing.
